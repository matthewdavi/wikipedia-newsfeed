# Wikipedia news feed
This is a quick and dirty chrome extension that replaces your careful and algorithmically curated news feed with a random and infinite set of wikipedia articles. This extension was inspired by this viral [hackernews-newsfeed](https://github.com/yczeng/hackernews-newsfeed) extension. You can install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfjffgmbadhdcbahjpeckoicligidmln/publish-accepted).
