# Wikipedia news feed
This is a quick and dirty chrome extension that replaces your careful and algorithmically curated news feed with a random and infinite set of wikipedia articles. This extension was inspired by my friend this viral [hackernews-newsfeed](https://github.com/yczeng/hackernews-newsfeed) extension.
